TO DO:
1. Support for any image size. Can potentially crop based on largest embeddable rectangle or something?
2. Quantitative evaluation showing your attack successfully compromises the target system
3. Measurement of how well your defense mitigates the attack, including trade-offs with legitimate performance
4. Testing whether your attack/defense generalizes to other models or datasetsd
